# Condor2 Revive Extension

A browser extension to be used in conjunction with the [Condor2 Revive Helper](https://github.com/TheGreatCabbage/condor2-revive-helper). This extension modifies the links on the [Condor Server List](http://www.condorsoaring.com/serverlist/?wdt_search=cndr2) to point to the Condor2 Revive Helper instead of Condor2.
